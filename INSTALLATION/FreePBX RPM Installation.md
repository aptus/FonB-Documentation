### 1. Getting Started
FonB is web based software addon to provide additional features to your Asterisk Server. These features include Phonebook for Asterisk, Highrise CRM Integration, FonB XML App for IP Phones, Call History XML App for IP Phones, Active Call Panel, Call Switching, Number Lookup, Number Rewrites etc. This document provides instructions to download, install and configure FonB from scratch. It is assumed that you have a fully functional Asterisk Server running in environment where FonB is to be installed. For integration with Highrise, it's assumed that you have a working Highrise CRM account to be integrated with Aptus FonB. Please be noted that this document is expected to be modified with time based on user input we are going to receive. Please feel free to report any issues in support forum.
<a name="solution-architecture"/>
####1.1. FonB Solution Architecture
FonB connects with Asterisk, Google, MySQL and Highrise (based on license type). With Asterisk, FonB needs to communicate with Asterisk AMI (manager.conf), Asterisk Dialplan (extensions.conf and extensions_custom.conf), Asterisk Call Recording Files (xxxxxx) and Asterisk CDR Database.

FonB communicates with MySQL for two reasons, first to handle its own records in a database and secondly, to deal with Asterisk CDR records.

User is supposed to inform FonB about these files in 3 configuration files, i.e. phoneb.cfg, users.cfg and php.ini (within FonB Installation directory), as explained in this document, section 5.

<a name="install-script"/>
####1.2. FonB Python Script (Deprecated)
Previous builds of FonB Install Script were all Python based script that could install FonB on FreePBX Systems. There was however a part where user had to logon to backend system and define/alter couple of files in CLI mode. Besides, any modification in FonB Administration required CLI access of the system which was confusing and sometimes not desirable by many users.

<a name="FreePBX-rpm"/>
####1.3. FonB RPM for FreePBX
The newest FonB RPM for FreePBX will further stabilize the application as a whole as well as provide GUI running on a separate port independent of FreePBX.
